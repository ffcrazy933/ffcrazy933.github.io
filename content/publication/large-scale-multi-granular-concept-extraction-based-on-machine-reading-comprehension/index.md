abstract: The concepts in knowledge graphs (KGs) enable machines to understand
  natural language, and thus play an indispensable role in many applications.
  However, existing KGs have the poor coverage of concepts, especially
  fine-grained concepts. In order to supply existing KGs with more fine-grained
  and new concepts, we propose a novel concept extraction framework, namely
  MRC-CE, to extract large-scale multi-granular concepts from the descriptive
  texts of entities. Specifically, MRC-CE is built with a machine reading
  comprehension model based on BERT, which can extract more fine-grained
  concepts with a pointer network. Furthermore, a random forest and rule-based
  pruning are also adopted to enhance MRC-CE's precision and recall
  simultaneously. Our experiments evaluated upon multilingual KGs, i.e., English
  Probase and Chinese CN-DBpedia, justify MRC-CE's superiority over the
  state-of-the-art extraction models in KG completion. Particularly, after
  running MRC-CE for each entity in CN-DBpedia, more than 7,053,900 new concepts
  (instanceOf relations) are supplied into the KG. The code and datasets have
  been released at https://github.com/fcihraeipnusnacwh/MRC-CE.
