abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotion
  for each utterance in a given conversation. The newly proposed ERC models have
  leveraged pre-trained language models (PLMs) with the paradigm of pre-training
  and fine-tuning to obtain good performance. However, these models seldom
  exploit PLMs' advantages thoroughly, and perform poorly for the conversations
  lacking explicit emotional expressions. In order to fully leverage the latent
  knowledge related to the emotional expressions in utterances, we propose a
  novel ERC model CISPER with the new paradigm of prompt and language model (LM)
  tuning. Specifically, CISPER is equipped with the prompt blending the
  contextual information and commonsense related to the interlocutor's
  utterances, to achieve ERC more effectively. Our extensive experiments
  demonstrate CISPER's superior performance over the state-of-the-art ERC
  models, and the effectiveness of leveraging these two kinds of significant
  prompt information for performance gains. To reproduce our experimental
  results conveniently, CISPER's sourcecode and the datasets have been shared at
