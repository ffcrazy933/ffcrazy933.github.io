Siyu Yuan is a second-year Ph.D. studentat the School of Data Science in Fudan University and a member of [KW FUDAN Lab](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/), supervised by Associate [Prof. Deqing Yang](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/people/yangdeqing/) and [Prof. Yanghua Xiao](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/people/xiaoyanghua/).

She is devoted to acquiring knowledge, especially **meta-knowledge** based on pre-trained language models and making machines have the human-like cognitive abilities. Main interested research topics include (but not limited to)

* **Symbolic knowledge distillation**, especially distilling symbolic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and transferring it to smaller but specialized models to enhance their performance.
* **LLM prompt engineering**, especially on endow appropriate instructions with COT to LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, BLOOM, BLOOMZ, LLaMA) for various kinds of task.
* **Knowledge acquisition**, especially on excavating knowledge based on pre-trained language models, including concept acquisition, script generation and analogy making.
